The message from teacher: From now on, you will use this article to include every single activity that you do in English in a chronological order (e.g. reading a book in English, watching TV shows and series in English, going to an English Evening in Mons, travelling to an English-speaking country, playing games in English such as the pretty exciting game LyricsTraining, etc.). You can even write a few lines about what you’ve watched/read/done and recommend certain things to your friends. The sky’s the limit! We value personal initiative and we will be happy to read whatever you have to offer.

So i will respect this mission , up to mow i have strarted by cummicate with people in a shop who speak english and i have watched video in VO on youtube about power of the cells, leaf and walkers protein.

The 4th of october I have send messages with foreign people whith who I communicate.
The weekend of the 5th and the 6th October , I have been working about the kingdom of Chromista and Animalia and I looked after informations about the Kingdom of EuKaryota. 
I sarted to build a systematic classification. For that, I have consulted website like http://www.marinespecies.org/index.php and http://nordicmicroalgae.org/galleries/norwegian-sea who are useful to class Animalia. 
I have used  https://www.algaebase.org/search/species/ too, because this website is interesting for its informations of the Algae and being organism.

The days following I have seen video in english only (without subtitle) about animals and I read my lesson of biochimie in English because the book of pratical work is in french version and in English version too.

The week of the 14th of October, I watched series and video in English only when I had time, and have put my application google chrome in English. 
Up to now, I have use it to search information when I work for University because I noticed that I have more results about the topics researched.

The 24th of October I started Lyricstraining with friends, and did lots of song. There are the links of the song from youtube:

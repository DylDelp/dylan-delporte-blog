# The message from teacher 

From now on, you will use this article to include every single activity that you do in English in a chronological order (e.g. reading a book in English, watching TV shows and series in English, going to an English Evening in Mons, travelling to an English-speaking country, playing games in English such as the pretty exciting game LyricsTraining, etc.). You can even write a few lines about what you’ve watched/read/done and recommend certain things to your friends. The sky’s the limit! We value personal initiative and we will be happy to read whatever you have to offer.

So i will respect this mission , up to mow i have strarted by cummicate with people in a shop who speak english and i have watched video in VO on youtube about power of the cells, leaf and walkers protein.

# My activity log 

## The 4th, 5th, 6th of October 2019 and the days following

The weekend of the 5th and the 6th October , I have been working about the kingdom of Chromista and Animalia and I looked after informations about the Kingdom of EuKaryota. 
I sarted to build a systematic classification. For that, I have consulted website like http://www.marinespecies.org/index.php and http://nordicmicroalgae.org/galleries/norwegian-sea who are useful to class Animalia. 
I have used  https://www.algaebase.org/search/species/ too, because this website is interesting for its informations of the Algae and being organism.

The days following I have seen video in english only (without subtitle) about animals and I read my lesson of biochimie in English because the book of pratical work is in french version and in English version too.

## The week of the 14th of October 2019

The week of the 14th of October, I watched series and video in English only when I had time, and have put my application google chrome in English.

I pratised my English with Richardné during the pratical work of molecular biology. She is the assitant of the pratical work and she come from Thailand. She explained me how i need to make things and the aim of each method.

## The 01st of March 2020

I found a video about iridescence as camouflage and I decided to post a article about this topic. I have never imagined that the iredescent colours can be use like a camouflage or signal that the potential prey is toxic.

# The Friday 13th of March 2020 

In Belgium , The state decided to start a containment because of Coranavirus. So, I study at home and when i have time i watch video to make explaination about my mimicry articles. It's complicated to be educationnalist or teacher.

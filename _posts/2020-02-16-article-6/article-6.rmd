| General topic?               | The general topic is the giant squids genome  |
| Conclusions/discovery?       | If species lose Hox Genes or if species gain Hox gene, its body plan will change. That have for consequence that the species can lose or gain a fundamental advantage to survive from the natural selection |
| Remaining questions?         | There are no remaining questions at the end of the article |
